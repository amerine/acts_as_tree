# ActsAsTree

A gem that extends ActiveRecord to add simple support for organizing items into
parentâ€“children relationships.

## Example

    class Category < ActiveRecord::Base
      include ActiveRecord::Acts::Tree

      acts_as_tree order: "name"
    end

    root      = Category.create("name" => "root")
    child1    = root.children.create("name" => "child1")
    subchild1 = child1.children.create("name" => "subchild1")

    root.parent   # => nil
    child1.parent # => root
    root.children # => [child1]
    root.children.first.children.first # => subchild1

## Compatibility

We no longer support Ruby 1.8 or versions if Rails/ActiveRecord older than 3.0. If you're using a version of ActiveRecord older than 3.0 please use 0.1.1.

Moving forward we will do our best to support the latest versions of ActiveRecord and Ruby.

## Note on Patches/Pull Requests

1. Fork the project.
2. Make your feature addition or bug fix.
3. Add tests for it. This is important so we don't break it in a future version
   unintentionally.
4. Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (if you want to have
   your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself so we can
   ignore when we pull)
5. Send us a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
